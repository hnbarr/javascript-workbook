The code plan behind my towers of hanoi.

My project was already completed a few weeks ago, and I wasnt assigned a .md file to be included at that time. 
I see it's worth 20 points of my grade, so I wanted to make sure I updated my pull request with this file.

When starting this project, I was thinking of the gamne itself and what all makes the game work. Things like;

1. being able to move a block from stack to stack, by selecting a, b or c.

2. ONLY being able to move the last block in the stack.

3. ONLY being able to move sed block onto another stack, IF stack's last block is bigger than moving block.

4. how to win the game, and what that looks like.

5. and finally how to put it all together! 

This was a fun assisngment and I really enjoy playing it in my terminal.
